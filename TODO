✔ Create L1-5 keycards with relevant textures (sent above on Discord) @done(20-06-21 21:53)
✔ Pair keycards to the corresponding “reader” skulls (in the center of the research commons area) @done(20-06-21 22:24)
✔ Make sure keycards function properly (ex. L3s can open L1 and L2-required doors) @done(20-06-21 22:36)
✔ Set the voicelines and subsequent flickers, etc. to occur at the designated zones (there should be diamond blocks with signs in the research bunking area that talks about it). @done(20-06-22 01:15)
✔ Remove title card in the “blackout” and time the blackout time with the audio @done(20-06-22 01:16)
✔ Update the intro voicelines to the new ones (sent below on Discord) @done(20-06-22 01:16)
✘ Make it so if you right-click a flint item that is in your inventory, it will set your spawn point to where you are (a sort of save function) and say in chat— &9[Save point set.] I will retexture it sometime. @cancelled(20-06-22 17:50)
✔ Change L1 card texture to this, since the current one has the "1" far too large and it irks me. It is irksome. @done(20-06-22 17:58)
✔ Make it so keycard readers will either tell you in actionbar near inventory “[Access Granted]”, or “[Access Denied—L3+ Card Required]”, or whatever L# the reader is @done(20-06-22 19:01)
✔ Implement the keycard accepted/door open sound (sent on Discord) @done(20-06-22 19:01)
✔ Implement the keycard denied sound (sent on Discord) @done(20-06-22 19:01)
✔ Also, hitting this button will clear their inventory and give them only one item—their L1 Card. @done(20-06-22 19:53)
✔ It can then spawn the player in their bunk and start the game. @done(20-06-22 20:38)
✔ Tutorial center is now done—the button at the very end of the hall should put the player(s) in spectator mode, black out the screen—and small white titles on the screen should say “0853 Hours. 15th of April, 2012. Northern Seattle.” @done(20-06-22 20:58)
✔ tp far away players in s2 cutscene @done(20-06-24 21:58)
✘ Teslagates - make ‘em. There is the frame of one in the tutorial center. Make it so it activates if any player is within 10 blocks of it (electricity through it, the usual). It activates once every 3 seconds. If the player is standing in it when it activates, instant death. @cancelled(20-06-24 22:22)
✘ glow outline with the thing in mc cmds discord (on card readers) @cancelled(20-06-25 00:59)
✔ Make it so in the intro, when the bridge falls and just before the blackout, explosion particles are summoned on the player (give it a sense of “o yeah, that’s what knocked me out and not the collapse of a platform I’m observing from a distance”)—can give it the explosion sound too if you want @done(20-06-30 23:04)
